# Git

## Commits
- Match the repository's existing commit style (conventional commits, etc.)
- Limit subject line to 50 characters
- Use imperative mood in subject ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Run `git status` before committing
- Do not reference internal files (todo.md, feedback.md) in commit messages

## Safety
- No destructive git operations (force push, hard reset) without explicit permission
