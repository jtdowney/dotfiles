# Code Style

- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions; make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement
- Match the existing style and conventions in each file
- Prefer built-in formatters for each language (gofmt, cargo fmt, mix format, ruff)
- No inline code comments unless requested; module docs/docstrings are acceptable
- Preserve existing comments unless clearly wrong; if wrong, flag them in your summary rather than deleting silently
