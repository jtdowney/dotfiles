# Save Plan

Think hard and write out a `plan.md` file in Markdown format. This file should be detailed enough that a junior engineer can implement the entire project without needing clarification.

Include the following sections:

## Overview
- Describe the high-level goal and scope of the project.

## Phases
Break the work into logical phases. For each phase, include:
- Objectives
- Required inputs
- Expected outputs
- Implementation steps
- TDD-focused testing strategy (unit and integration where relevant)

## Checklist
Include a Markdown checklist for the entire plan. Each item should map to a concrete implementation or validation task.

## Assumptions
List any assumptions made. If there are areas that require clarification or external decisions, flag them clearly.

## Dependencies
Document any external libraries, APIs, services, or tools that are required.

---

The resulting `plan.md` should be structured, precise, testable, and ready for execution by a junior engineer starting tomorrow.
