# RFC 2119 Requirement Levels

These keywords indicate requirement levels in IETF standards. Case-insensitive.

## MUST / REQUIRED / SHALL
Absolute requirement. Non-compliance means the implementation is non-conformant.

## MUST NOT / SHALL NOT
Absolute prohibition. Violating this means the implementation is non-conformant.

## SHOULD / RECOMMENDED
Valid reasons may exist to ignore, but full implications must be understood and carefully weighed.

## SHOULD NOT / NOT RECOMMENDED
Valid reasons may exist to allow, but full implications must be understood and carefully weighed.

## MAY / OPTIONAL
Truly optional. Implementations that omit this are still conformant.

## Evaluation Priority

1. **MUST/MUST NOT** - Evaluate first. Any violation is a compliance failure.
2. **SHOULD/SHOULD NOT** - Evaluate second. Document deviations with justification.
3. **MAY** - Evaluate last. Note whether optional features are implemented.
