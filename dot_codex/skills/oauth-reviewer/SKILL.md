# OAuth 2.0 Security Review (RFC 9700)

Review OAuth implementations against [RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.txt) — OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Ask the user:
- **Role**: Client, authorization server, resource server, or combination?
- **Client type**: Public (SPA, native app, CLI) or confidential (server-side)?
- **Grant types used**: Authorization code, client credentials, device code?
- **Focus areas**: Any known concerns or specific flows to prioritize?

### 2. Identify OAuth Components

Locate in the codebase:
- Authorization request construction / handling
- Token endpoint requests / responses
- Redirect URI registration and validation
- PKCE implementation (code_verifier / code_challenge)
- Refresh token storage and rotation
- Token validation and audience checks
- Client authentication mechanisms
- State / nonce parameter handling

### 3. Evaluate Against Checklist

Work through the checklist below, rating each applicable item:
- **✅ Compliant** — Requirement fully satisfied
- **⚠️ Partial** — Met with caveats or gaps
- **❌ Non-compliant** — Violated or missing
- **➖ N/A** — Doesn't apply to this role/type
- **❓ Unknown** — Cannot determine from code inspection

See [rfc9700-requirements.md](references/rfc9700-requirements.md) for full requirement text and RFC section references.
See [attack-patterns.md](references/attack-patterns.md) for attack scenarios and detection guidance.

### 4. Report Findings

Structure the report as:
1. **Summary** — Overall posture, critical issues count
2. **Scope** — Role, client type, flows evaluated
3. **Critical Findings** — MUST/MUST NOT violations (highest priority)
4. **Recommendations** — SHOULD deviations worth fixing
5. **Detailed Analysis** — Section-by-section findings with code references

Cite both RFC sections (`RFC 9700 §2.1`) and code locations (`src/oauth.rs:142`).

## Example

User: "review our OAuth client implementation for security"

1. Ask: "Is this a public or confidential client? Does it use multiple authorization servers?"
2. Locate auth flow: redirect URI handling, PKCE generation, token storage
3. Walk through checklist focusing on client requirements (R1–R4, P1/P2, C1, T4, RT1–RT3)
4. Check for deprecated grants (D1, D2)
5. Report findings with code locations and RFC section citations
